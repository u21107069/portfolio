          <p> " Here’s some skills and facts about me!"
		  I'm Palestinian, my birthday is on January 3rd, and I’m 170cm tall. I’m a ramen lover, a bit of a foodie, and always up for trying something new. I’m an extrovert who enjoys meeting new people and being part of group activities — I love good vibes and good conversations. I’m also a creative thinker who’s full of ideas and always looking for fun ways to express them. A fun skill that i have always had is that I can memorize things super fast just by seeing them — kind of like a photographic memory! Whether it’s learning something new or working on a team project, I always bring energy, focus, and a positive attitude.</p>

          <p>"What i love to do in my free time", 
		  One, staying active and exploring new experiences. I’m a big fan of the gym and i enjoy trying out different sports — anything that keeps me moving and energized. I also love discovering new restaurants and cozy cafes; there's something exciting about finding new spots and enjoying good food and COFFEE. Shopping and clothes is another passion of mine — I love expressing myself through fashion. I’m also into photography, especially when it comes to capturing fun moments with friends and families, making lasting memories. Whether it’s a casual day out or a full adventure, I always try to make the most of every moment.</p>

          <p>" Places I Want to Visit 🌍"
			Traveling is definitely on my bucket list — I’d love to explore places that mix city life with beautiful beaches and culture. Paris is a dream for the fashion, art, and café scenes. Italy is calling me with its history, style, and of course… pasta! Bali is high on my list too — the beaches, nature, and peaceful vibes are everything. Honestly, anywhere that combines a good view, good food, and good energy is my kind of place.</p>
